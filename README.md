# Deadlink-Hunter-Website🕵️

Deadlink-Hunter is an open-source project designed to find broken links in GitHub repositories (with future support for other platforms).
The goal is to help maintainers keep their documentation clean, reliable, and frustration-free for readers.

Deadlink Hunder Website is the frontend of the website.

You can also check [Broken-Link-Checker](https://github.com/Deadlink-Hunter/Broken-Link-Checker), this is the backend of the project that check if a link is broken or not.

The project was inspires as a way to give back to the open source community, everyone is welcome.

## The why

Documentation is the first entry point for most developers exploring a project.
Yet, README files and docs often contain outdated or broken links – even in large, well-maintained repositories.

But aren’t there already broken link checkers?
There are — but most of them don’t look very good, their UIs are not user-friendly, and their broken link detection doesn’t cover all cases (for example, localhost:4000 is not actually broken).

## Docker Setup

This project includes Docker support for easy deployment and development. You can run the application using Docker in two ways:

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the application is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Build and start the application
docker-compose up --build

# Or run in detached mode (background)
docker-compose up --build -d
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost`

To stop the application:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Option 2: Using Docker directly

You can also build and run the Docker container directly:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t deadlink-hunter .

# Run the container
docker run -p 80:6006 deadlink-hunter
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost`

### Docker Configuration

- **Port**: The application runs on port `6006` inside the container and is mapped to port `80` on your host machine
- **Web Server**: Uses nginx to serve the built application
- **Build Process**: Multi-stage build that installs dependencies, builds the app, and serves it with nginx
- **Base Image**: Built on `node:20-alpine` for the build stage and `nginx:1.27-alpine` for the runtime
